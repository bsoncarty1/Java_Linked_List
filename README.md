# Java_Linked_List

This is a Lab that I did in my Java Programming Principles II class. At this point in time, I had a little bit of experience using LinkedLists, but this 
assignment challenged me and made my understanding of how they worked more solid.

The LinkedList in this class has a dummy head node. Before this, the LinkedList code I worked on either had a head or a tail so this was new to me.
I am proud of this Lab because I was able to create all of the methods for the menu in the main method successfully while implementing a clear coding style.
